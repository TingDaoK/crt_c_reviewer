      "line": 40,
      "body": "Consider renaming `can_block` to something more descriptive like `is_high_priority` or `allows_forced_allocation`. The current name doesn't clearly communicate that this is about whether the reservation should proceed even if it exceeds memory limits."

      "line": 52,
      "body": "The function name `claim` is somewhat ambiguous. A more descriptive name like `get_buffer` or `acquire_buffer` would better indicate its purpose of fetching the associated buffer."

      "body": "The flag `AWS_S3_REQUEST_FLAG_ALLOCATE_BUFFER_FROM_POOL` might benefit from a more explicit name like `AWS_S3_REQUEST_FLAG_USE_BUFFER_POOL` to better distinguish it from a direct allocation."

      "body": "The function type `aws_s3_buffer_pool_factory_fn` could be more explicitly named as `aws_s3_custom_buffer_pool_factory_fn` to emphasize that it's for creating custom pool implementations."

      "body": "Consider renaming `illegal_usage_terminate_meta_request` to something more specific like `buffer_allocation_failed` since it's now specifically used to indicate failure to acquire a buffer from the pool."
