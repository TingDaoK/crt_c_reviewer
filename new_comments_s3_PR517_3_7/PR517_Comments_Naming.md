# PR 517 Comments: Memory Pool Interface

This PR introduces a memory pool interface to allow consumers to override the memory pooling behavior of the CRT client. Below are comments focused specifically on function and variable naming within the PR.

## s3_buffer_pool.h (New File)

- Lines 30-32: The `aws_future_s3_buffer_ticket` type and declaration follows AWS common pattern for future types, good choice.

- Lines 35-43: In `aws_s3_buffer_pool_reserve_meta`, consider renaming `can_block` to something more descriptive like `is_high_priority` or `allows_forced_allocation` as it's not immediately clear what "blocking" means in this context.

- Lines 52-55: In `aws_s3_buffer_ticket_vtable`, the function name `claim` is somewhat ambiguous. A more descriptive name like `get_buffer` or `acquire_buffer` would better indicate its purpose to fetch the associated buffer.

- Lines 91-99: In the `aws_s3_buffer_pool_config` struct, the naming of `part_size` and `max_part_size` is clear, but `memory_limit` might benefit from being renamed to `total_memory_limit` to be more explicit.

## s3_default_buffer_pool.h (Renamed File)

- Lines 31-34: The renaming from `aws_s3_buffer_pool` to `aws_s3_default_buffer_pool` is appropriate since it's now the default implementation of the interface.

- Lines 36-39: The naming change from `aws_s3_buffer_pool_ticket` to `aws_s3_default_buffer_ticket` follows the same pattern and is appropriate.

- Lines 72-74: The function `aws_s3_default_buffer_pool_reserve` has consistent naming with the new interface, which is good.

## s3_default_buffer_pool.c (New File)

- Lines 45-47: The naming of `s_default_ticket_claim` is consistent with the vtable function name, though as mentioned earlier, a more descriptive name might be better.

- Lines 49-64: The wrapper function name `s_wrap_default_ticket` clearly conveys its purpose to wrap a default ticket implementation.

- Line 66-70: The function name `s_default_pool_reserve` is appropriately named according to its purpose.

- Line 612: The function `aws_s3_buffer_ticket_claim` maintains consistency with the vtable function name.

## s3_meta_request.c

- Line 724-742: The new callback function `s_on_pool_buffer_reserved` has a clear name that indicates its purpose as a callback for when buffer reservation completes.

- Line 773-774: Consider renaming `illegal_usage_terminate_meta_request` to something more specific like `buffer_allocation_failed` since it's now specifically used to indicate failure to acquire a buffer from the pool.

## s3_auto_ranged_put.c

- Lines 561-590: The variable names and function calls follow consistent naming conventions, which is good. However, the usage of flag `AWS_S3_REQUEST_FLAG_ALLOCATE_BUFFER_FROM_POOL` might benefit from a more explicit name like `AWS_S3_REQUEST_FLAG_USE_BUFFER_POOL` to distinguish it from a direct allocation.

## Overall Naming Suggestions:

1. The new error code `AWS_ERROR_S3_BUFFER_ALLOCATION_FAILED` is well-named and specific to the failure condition.

2. Consider renaming `ticket` to something that better conveys its purpose as a reservation token, perhaps `buffer_reservation` or `pool_reservation_token`.

3. In `aws_s3_meta_request_receive_body_extra_info`, the variable `ticket` might be better named as `buffer_ticket` or `buffer_source` to clearly indicate its relationship to the buffer.

4. The function `aws_s3_buffer_pool_factory_fn` could be more explicitly named as `aws_s3_custom_buffer_pool_factory_fn` to emphasize that it's for creating custom implementations.

5. The rename from `has_part_size_response_body` to `should_allocate_buffer_from_pool` is an improvement as it better describes the flag's purpose, but consider `uses_pool_allocated_buffer` for even more clarity.
