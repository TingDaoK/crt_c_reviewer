# Analysis of PR476 Comments: "4 New EC2 Instances with Recommended Configuration"

## Overview
This document analyzes the review comments provided by GitHub user `graebm` on Pull Request #476 for the repository `awslabs/aws-c-s3`. The PR was about adding 4 new EC2 instances with recommended configuration.

## Review Style Analysis

### 1. Attention to Formatting Consistency

The reviewer paid careful attention to notation consistency within the codebase:

- Questioned the mixed use of underscores (`_`) and dots (`.`) in instance naming conventions
- Highlighted inconsistency in comment style where notation switched from `.` to `_` 
- Used terms like "trivial" to indicate minor issues that should be addressed but aren't critical blockers

This demonstrates that reviewers value consistent formatting and notation throughout a codebase, even when the inconsistencies don't affect functionality.

### 2. Cross-Team Coordination Awareness

The comment "need to coordinate with python teams on this..." shows that the reviewer is thinking about:

- Dependencies and impacts across different teams and services
- The importance of communication between teams when making changes that might affect multiple codebases
- Cross-organizational alignment when adding new feature support

This highlights the importance of considering the broader ecosystem impact of changes, not just the immediate code.

### 3. Review Process Approach

The reviewer's process showed a progression:
1. First provided targeted specific comments on formatting/style issues
2. Later placed a placeholder comment (".") - likely to track that they were reviewing the PR
3. Eventually approved the PR after the contributor addressed the initial concerns

The reviewer approved the PR after the contributor clarified the reasoning ("It's a section for the p5 family...") and made improvements ("I have gotten rid of `_` since it was confusing and made the sections explicit.").

### 4. Conciseness in Communication

The comments were brief but clear:
- Short questions that pinpointed specific issues
- No unnecessary explanations
- Direct references to exact locations in the code

This demonstrates effective reviewing by being concise yet specific, allowing the contributor to quickly understand and address concerns.

## Key Takeaways for Future PR Comments

1. **Be Consistent**: Ensure comments highlight inconsistencies in code formatting, naming conventions, and documentation style.

2. **Consider Cross-Team Impact**: Always mention when changes might require coordination with other teams or services.

3. **Be Specific**: Point to exact locations in the code where issues exist.

4. **Be Concise**: Keep comments brief but clear - ask direct questions rather than making lengthy explanations.

5. **Follow Up**: Track the PR through the review process and acknowledge when issues have been addressed.

6. **Progressive Approval**: Start with specific concerns, and move to approval once issues are resolved.

7. **Use Qualification Terms**: Indicate severity of issues with terms like "trivial" for minor formatting issues versus more serious concerns.

8. **Identify Patterns**: Look for repeated issues throughout the submission rather than flagging only the first instance.

## Conclusion

The review process demonstrated in PR476 shows effective code review practices focused on consistency, clarity, and cross-team coordination. The reviewer was attentive to detail while maintaining appropriate perspective on the severity of different issues.
