### Context and Communication Style
1. **Casual, familiar tone:** The reviewer used an informal, conversational style suggesting a comfortable working relationship with the PR author.

2. **Inside references/team culture:** The comment references what appears to be a team saying or programming philosophy ("Red code is best code") - likely referring to the principle that removed/deleted code is often the best improvement to a codebase. This suggests the team has shared values around code simplicity and removing unused elements.

3. **Concise approval:** Despite the slight correction to what seems to be a referenced quote in the PR description, the reviewer approved the changes without requiring additional modifications, indicating confidence in the proposed changes.

4. **Humor in technical reviews:** The lighthearted tone ("but sure") shows that reviews can contain personality while still maintaining technical rigor. The comment appears to be gently correcting a misquoted saying while still endorsing the PR's intent.

### Technical Focus
The PR was straightforward - removing unused platform information. The brevity of the review suggests:
1. The changes were non-controversial
2. Removing unused code is generally considered a positive practice
3. The reviewer trusted the author's assessment that the information was indeed unused

## Communication Patterns to Adopt

When making similar comments in the future:

1. **Keep technical correctness as the priority:** Even in casual exchanges, ensure technical details are accurate.

2. **Be concise when possible:** When changes are straightforward and correct, lengthy reviews are unnecessary.

3. **Acknowledge team culture:** References to shared team values or sayings can reinforce culture while keeping communication personable.

4. **Balance formality:** Technical reviews can be friendly and contain personality while still maintaining professional standards.

5. **Express clear approval/disapproval:** Even with casual communication, make the final assessment (APPROVED/CHANGES REQUESTED) clear.

6. **Context awareness:** Comments that might seem cryptic to outsiders may be perfectly clear to team members with shared context - consider the audience when determining how much explanation is needed.

7. **Focus on what matters:** The review didn't dwell on minor issues and focused on the core purpose of the PR - whether the unused code should be removed.

## Conclusion

This review demonstrates that effective PR comments in an established team can be brief, slightly casual, and still maintain technical rigor. The reviewer communicated their approval clearly while also maintaining a touch of personality through the correction of a team saying.

When making future comments on pull requests, this balance of technical correctness, awareness of team culture, and appropriate conciseness can serve as a good model.
