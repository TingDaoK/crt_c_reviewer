## Lessons for Future PR Comments

When reviewing PRs, especially automated ones:

1. **Comment Economy:**
   - If a PR is straightforward and works as expected, it may be appropriate to approve without comments
   - Save detailed comments for cases where feedback or changes are necessary

2. **Context Awareness:**
   - Adjust comment detail based on PR type (automated vs. manual)
   - Automated/routine updates may require less scrutiny if the automation is trusted

3. **Implicit Trust:**
   - Approving without comments demonstrates confidence in the process or author
   - This approach works well for routine updates or when working with trusted systems/teammates

4. **Efficiency:**
   - Not all PRs require extensive comments - prioritize where feedback adds value
   - Quick approval of routine changes helps maintain project velocity

5. **Appropriate Scrutiny Level:**
   - Apply higher scrutiny (and more comments) to:
     * Manual changes
     * Core functionality updates
     * Security-sensitive code
     * Changes from new contributors
   - Apply lower scrutiny to trusted automated processes and routine updates

In summary, the reviewer's approach demonstrates efficient PR review practices - knowing when detailed comments are necessary versus when a simple approval is sufficient for routine automated updates.
