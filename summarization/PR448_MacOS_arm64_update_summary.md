## Review Style Analysis
The reviewer (graebm) approved this pull request without leaving explicit comments. This suggests:

1. **Silent approval for straightforward changes:** When changes are well-aligned with project goals and technically sound, reviewers may approve without extensive commentary.

3. **Efficiency in review process:** For routine infrastructure updates like architecture changes, the review process can be streamlined when the changes are clear and necessary.

## Lessons for Future Pull Request Comments

When reviewing similar PRs:

1. **Be explicit about approval for infrastructure changes:** Even simple approvals can benefit from a brief statement like "Changes look good. Support for arm64 is necessary given Apple's architecture transition."

2. **Acknowledge necessity of backward compatibility:** For PRs maintaining compatibility (like keeping x64 testing), note the importance: "Good job maintaining x64 testing alongside the new arm64 default."

3. **Recognize naming convention updates:** When terminology is standardized (like "osx" to "macos"), affirm these changes: "Appropriate modernization of terminology throughout."

4. **Keep it simple for straightforward changes:** Not every PR needs extensive comments. Clear, necessary changes can receive simple approval when they're well-implemented.

The absence of detailed comments in this PR suggests that the changes were straightforward, necessary, and well-executed, requiring no specific feedback or corrections.
