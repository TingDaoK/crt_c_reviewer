# Analysis of Comments on PR468: Support full object checksum

## Overview
This analysis examines the comments made on GitHub Pull Request #468 in the aws-c-s3 repository. The PR focused on adding support for using crc64nvme as S3 checksum and support for full object checksums.

## Comment Analysis

### Comment #1
- **Reviewer**: graebm
- **Comment**: "LGTM (previously reviewed in private repo)"
- **Review State**: APPROVED
- **Date**: 2024-12-05

### Context
The PR was previously reviewed in private repositories before being submitted to the public repository:
- aws-c-s3-staging PR #34
- aws-c-s3-staging PR #29

## Patterns and Insights

### 1. Acknowledging Prior Review
The reviewer explicitly mentioned that the code had been previously reviewed in a private repository. This is an important practice that:
- Provides context for other team members
- Explains the brevity of the public review
- Establishes that due diligence has already been performed
- Creates transparency regarding the review process

### 2. Use of Abbreviations
The reviewer used "LGTM" (Looks Good To Me), which is a common abbreviation in software development indicating approval. Using standard industry abbreviations can make comments more concise while remaining clear to the intended audience.

### 3. Formal Review State
Despite the brief comment, the reviewer formally marked the PR as "APPROVED", which is critical for the workflow process and permission gates in most GitHub repositories.

### 4. Brevity When Appropriate
The brevity of the comment is appropriate given the context that a more detailed review had already taken place in another repository. This demonstrates that comment length should match the circumstances rather than following a one-size-fits-all approach.

## Best Practices for Future PR Comments

1. **Provide Context**: If a review is brief due to prior work or discussion, explicitly mention this to avoid confusion.

2. **Be Clear About Approval**: Use both informal language (like "LGTM") and formal review states (like "Approved") to ensure clarity.

3. **Reference Previous Work**: When applicable, reference previous PRs, issues, or private discussions to provide a trail of documentation.

4. **Match Comment Detail to Need**: Detailed reviews need detailed comments, but repeating already-completed reviews isn't necessary if that's clearly communicated.

5. **Use Standard Terminology**: Industry-standard abbreviations and terms are appropriate when communicating with technical teammates.

6. **Include Timestamps or Versions**: In some cases, including when approval was given or which version was reviewed can be helpful for tracking purposes.

## Conclusion
The comment on PR468 demonstrates effective communication within a development team that spans private and public repositories. While brief, it provides sufficient context about the review process and clearly indicates approval status. Future PR comments should similarly balance brevity with necessary context, especially when work spans multiple repositories or includes prior reviews.
