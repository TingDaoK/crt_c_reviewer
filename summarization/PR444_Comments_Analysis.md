### Review Style Observations

1. **Focus on Correctness**: The reviewer prioritized technical accuracy, even in documentation.
   
2. **Brevity**: The comment was concise and to the point, without unnecessary explanations.
   
3. **Efficiency**: The reviewer approved the PR shortly after making the minor suggestion, not blocking progress over small issues.
   
4. **Use of GitHub Features**: The reviewer used GitHub's suggestion feature to propose the exact change needed, which enables one-click acceptance.
   
5. **Prioritization**: By labeling the comment as "trivial," the reviewer made it clear this was not a blocking issue.
   
6. **Technical Precision**: The comment showed attention to detail about API documentation accuracy.

## Best Practices for Future PR Comments

1. **Use GitHub's suggestion feature** for precise code changes that can be accepted with a click.
   
2. **Label comments by severity** (e.g., "trivial," "important," "blocking") to help the author prioritize changes.
   
3. **Be concise** - make the point clearly without unnecessary words.
   
4. **Focus on technical accuracy** - even for documentation comments.
   
5. **Don't delay approval** for minor issues that don't affect functionality.
   
6. **Use code formatting** in comments when referencing code.
   
7. **Be specific** about what needs to change and why (when necessary).
   
8. **Consider context** - this PR implemented a feature request, and the review focused on ensuring correct implementation.

## Example of Effective Comment Style

```
trivial: 
```suggestion
    /* An array of `struct aws_byte_cursor` of network interface names. */
    const struct aws_byte_cursor *network_interface_names_array;
```
```

This example shows how to make a clear, actionable comment that:
- Indicates priority level
- Uses GitHub's suggestion feature
- Provides the exact replacement code
- Uses appropriate code formatting

The efficiency of this review process highlights the value of focusing on substantive issues while still addressing minor corrections in a way that facilitates easy fixes.
