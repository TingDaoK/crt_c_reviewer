# Analysis of Comments on PR478: [s3_client]: retry on failed TLS negotiation

## Overview
This analysis examines the comments made on Pull Request #478 in the aws-c-s3 repository. The PR was titled "[s3_client]: retry on failed TLS negotiation" and was reviewed by GitHub user graebm.

## Comment Analysis

### Comment Context
The single review comment provided by graebm was:
> "Checked the C++ SDK and Java SDK and they also retry on TLS errors."

This comment was part of an APPROVED review submitted on December 18, 2024.

### Comment Characteristics and Patterns

1. **Cross-reference validation**: The reviewer explicitly mentioned checking other related AWS SDKs (C++ and Java) to validate that the proposed behavior aligns with existing implementations across the AWS ecosystem. This demonstrates a pattern of ensuring consistency across different language implementations.

2. **Conciseness**: The comment was brief and to the point, focusing only on the specific validation performed rather than providing unnecessary details.

3. **Positive reinforcement**: The comment supported the PR's approach by confirming it matches established patterns in other codebases, which provides confidence in the implementation decision.

4. **Approval with reasoning**: The reviewer didn't just approve the PR but provided the specific reasoning behind the approval, making the decision transparent.

## Key Takeaways for Future Comments

When commenting on pull requests, especially for AWS or other multi-language ecosystem projects:

1. **Verify cross-implementation consistency**: Check if the proposed change aligns with how similar functionality is implemented in related SDKs or libraries, especially when dealing with error handling, retry logic, or API behaviors.

2. **Keep comments focused**: Provide clear, concise feedback that directly addresses the key aspects of the implementation.

3. **Support assertions with evidence**: When making claims about best practices or consistency, cite specific examples (as the reviewer did by referencing other SDKs).

4. **Provide context for approvals**: When approving a PR, include the reasoning behind the approval to help others understand the decision-making process.

5. **Focus on behavioral aspects**: The comment focused on the behavioral aspect (retrying on TLS errors) rather than implementation details, suggesting that consistency in behavior across SDKs is particularly important.

## Conclusion

This review comment, while brief, demonstrates effective reviewing practices for AWS service libraries. It focuses on cross-SDK consistency for error handling, which appears to be a key consideration for AWS libraries. Future comments should similarly validate cross-implementation consistency, especially for critical behaviors like error handling and retry logic.
