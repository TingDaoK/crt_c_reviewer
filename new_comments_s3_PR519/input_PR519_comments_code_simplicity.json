      "body": "**Code Simplicity Issue**: The function name `test_helper` is extremely vague and provides no information about what the function does.\n\n**Suggestion**: Rename to something descriptive like `s_build_test_endpoint_string` following AWS C SDK naming conventions where static helper functions are prefixed with `s_`.\n\nHowever, see next comment about removing this function entirely."

      "body": "**Code Simplicity Issue**: This helper function is completely unnecessary - it's just a simple wrapper that adds no value. It only calls one function and returns its result.\n\n**Suggestion**: Remove this helper function entirely and call `aws_s3_tester_build_endpoint_string` directly inline where needed. This would eliminate 5 lines of code and make the intent clearer."

      "body": "**Code Simplicity Issue**: This variable declaration is separated from other declarations and there's no error handling for the returned string.\n\n**Suggestion**: If removing the helper function as suggested, replace this line with:\n```c\nstruct aws_string *host_name = aws_s3_tester_build_endpoint_string(allocator, &g_test_public_bucket_name, &g_test_s3_region);\nif (host_name == NULL) {\n    goto cleanup;\n}\n```"

      "body": "**Code Simplicity Issue**: Missing memory management - the `host_name` string is allocated but never released, causing a memory leak.\n\n**Suggestion**: Add cleanup before the existing cleanup calls:\n```c\naws_string_destroy(host_name);\n```"

      "path": "tests/s3_data_plane_tests.c",
      "line": 8125,
      "body": "**Code Simplicity Issue**: The function doesn't follow the standard AWS C SDK error handling pattern with proper cleanup labels and error handling.\n\n**Suggestion**: Restructure to follow established patterns with consolidated variable declarations at the top, proper error handling, and a cleanup section. This would make the code more consistent with the rest of the codebase and prevent potential memory leaks."
