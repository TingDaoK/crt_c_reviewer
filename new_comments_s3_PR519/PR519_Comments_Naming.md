## Code Review for PR #519

### Function and Variable Naming Issues

#### Lines 8116-8117: Function `test_helper`
- The function name `test_helper` is too generic and doesn't clearly indicate its purpose. Consider renaming it to something more specific, such as `s3_test_build_endpoint_string` to match the function's purpose and the project's naming conventions. Other helper functions in this file follow the pattern of prefixing with `s_` for static functions and describing their specific purpose.

#### Line 8127: Variable `hsot_name`
- The variable `hsot_name` appears to be a typo for `host_name`. This should be corrected to maintain code clarity.

#### Line 8130-8143: Test Function
- This test case is almost identical to the `s_test_s3_default_get_without_content_length` function with only minor differences. Consider adding comments to explain what's different about this test case or consolidate the tests if they're testing the same functionality.

#### Overall Function Structure
- The new test case's naming doesn't follow the project's convention. Most test functions in the file follow the pattern `s_test_s3_[functionality]` but the new function uses `aws_test_s3_default_get`. Consider renaming it to follow the established pattern and maintain consistency with the rest of the codebase.
