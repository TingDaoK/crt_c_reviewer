Please see specific line comments below.\n\n**Additional Issues:** Variable name typo and missing error handling for potential NULL return.",

      "body": "**blocking:** Memory ownership issue - This helper function allocates an `aws_string` but doesn't clearly document ownership transfer. The returned string must be freed by the caller, but this creates potential for memory leaks.\n\n**Recommendation:** Add documentation about ownership or consider renaming to make ownership clear (e.g., `test_helper_create_hostname`)."
