      "body": "The function name `test_helper` is too generic. Consider renaming it to something more specific like `s3_test_build_endpoint_string` to match its purpose and the project's naming conventions. Also, consider adding a brief docstring explaining its purpose, parameters, and return value ownership, mentioning that the caller is responsible for freeing the returned string with `aws_string_destroy()`."
