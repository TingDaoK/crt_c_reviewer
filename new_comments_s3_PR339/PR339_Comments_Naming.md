# Code Review Comments: PR #339 - Function and Variable Naming

## Overall Assessment

This PR primarily replaces SwiftLint with Swift-Format, resulting in consistent formatting changes across multiple Swift files. The changes are mainly related to indentation (from 4 spaces to 2 spaces) and line spacing rather than actual code logic modifications. From a naming perspective, the PR doesn't introduce any new functions or variables, it simply reformats existing code.

## Observations on Naming Conventions

### Positive Aspects

1. The PR maintains consistent naming patterns that already existed in the codebase:
   - Class names use PascalCase (e.g., `EventStreamMessage`, `HTTPClientConnection`)
   - Function names use camelCase (e.g., `getCredentials()`, `withByteCursor()`)
   - Variables use camelCase (e.g., `rawValue`, `headerNameLength`)

2. The PR preserves appropriate naming for protocol declarations and extensions:
   - Interface protocols like `CStruct`, `CStructWithUserData`, and `CredentialsProviding` are named appropriately
   - Extensions maintain consistent naming with their base types

3. Enum cases in Swift-style using camelCase:
   - For example, in `LogLevel` enum: `.none`, `.fatal`, `.error`, etc.
   - In `SignatureType` enum: `.requestHeaders`, `.requestQueryParams`, etc.

### Naming Consistency Improvements

While no new functions or variables were added, the reformatting has actually improved readability of existing names by:

1. Better visual alignment of parameter lists in functions with long names, making it easier to distinguish between parameter names
2. More consistent spacing in multi-line function declarations, improving readability of parameter names
3. Consistent indentation in enumerations, enhancing the clarity of enum case names

## Conclusion

From a naming perspective, this PR doesn't introduce any issues. The consistent formatting applied by Swift-Format has actually enhanced the readability of existing function and variable names by providing a more uniform presentation throughout the codebase. The switch from SwiftLint to Swift-Format was well-executed from a naming perspective, maintaining consistency while improving overall code appearance.
