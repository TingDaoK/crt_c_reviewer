      "body": "**Important**: Inconsistent exception types across validation methods. `write_array_start()` raises `OverflowError` but `write_map_start()` and `write_tag()` raise `ValueError` for the same type of validation. Consider standardizing on `OverflowError` since it's more semantically appropriate for range validation."

      "body": "The negative integer encoding logic is correct per RFC 8949, but the flow could be clearer. When `val < 0`, you compute `val_to_encode = -1 - val` but then still check `if val >= 0`. Consider adding a comment explaining why we check the original `val` rather than `val_to_encode` to avoid confusion."
