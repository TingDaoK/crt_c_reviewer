  "body": "Excellent work on maintaining consistent naming conventions throughout the CBOR bindings implementation! 👍\n\nI've reviewed all function and variable names in this PR, and they perfectly follow the established AWS CRT Python coding standards:\n\n- ✅ All functions use proper `snake_case()` convention\n- ✅ Classes use correct `UpperCamelCase` with appropriate `Aws` prefix  \n- ✅ Private members correctly use underscore prefix\n- ✅ Static functions properly use `s_` prefix\n- ✅ Python bindings consistently use `aws_py_` prefix\n- ✅ Variable names are descriptive and follow `snake_case`\n- ✅ Macro names follow `ALL_CAPS` convention\n- ✅ Consistent naming patterns across similar functions (e.g., `write_*`, `pop_next_*`)\n\nThe naming is very thoughtful and makes the code highly readable and maintainable. No changes needed for function and variable naming.",
