  "body": "I've reviewed the changes to introduce a memory pool interface in aws-c-s3. This is a well-structured API design that follows CRT patterns and should provide good flexibility for consumers who need custom memory management strategies.\n\n### Strengths\n\n- Clean separation between interface and implementation using the vtable pattern\n- Good use of futures for asynchronous memory allocation\n- Consistent error handling and resource cleanup\n- Backward compatibility maintained while adding new capabilities\n- Thoughtful handling of the 'can_block' use case to avoid deadlocks\n\n### Minor suggestions\n\n- Consider adding more documentation for implementation requirements, especially around thread-safety expectations\n- The error code `AWS_ERROR_S3_BUFFER_ALLOCATION_FAILED` might benefit from clearer documentation about when it's raised vs. when operations might just block\n\nOverall, this looks like a well-designed addition to the library that will enable advanced users to customize memory management while keeping things simple for typical users.",
