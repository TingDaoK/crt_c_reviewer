      "body": "Important: The documentation should clarify that if the vtable `acquire`/`release` functions are NULL, the implementer must be sure to initialize the ref_count properly. Otherwise, there's a risk of memory leaks or use-after-free. Consider adding validation in the default implementations to guard against this case."

      "body": "Important: There's no validation here to check if `ticket->vtable->release` is NULL before calling it. If a consumer provides an incomplete implementation with NULL release function and doesn't initialize the ref count properly, this could lead to a use-after-free scenario. Consider adding a NULL check here."

      "path": "source/s3_meta_request.c",

      "body": "Important: If there's an error acquiring the buffer ticket, the function correctly calls `s_s3_prepare_request_payload_callback_and_destroy` which releases `payload->async_buffer_reserve`. However, in the success path, there's no explicit release of `future_ticket`. While this is likely handled correctly in subsequent code, it would be safer to be explicit about future ticket lifecycle to prevent potential memory leaks."

Consider refactoring to have clearer resource management with a more linear flow or adding explicit comments documenting the resource ownership transfer."
