Context:
This PR updated the MacOS CI configuration to default to arm64 architecture, added a new macos-x64 CI job, and updated the naming convention from "osx" to "macos" throughout the configuration. This change reflects Apple's transition to ARM-based processors and ensures testing on both architectures.
