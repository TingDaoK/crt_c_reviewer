Context:
This PR implemented support for machines with multiple Network Interface Cards (NICs) by adding an option to provide a list of interface names and distribute connections across these NICs. The change addressed issue #415.

Graebm's only comment was a trivial suggestion to fix a documentation comment by removing an asterisk from the description of the network interface names array type. He approved the PR shortly after making this suggestion.
