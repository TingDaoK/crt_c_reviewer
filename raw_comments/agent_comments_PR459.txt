   Comment: "An alternative where the vtable doesn't need to be a public global"
   
   Suggestion:
   ```
   struct aws_s3_client *client = aws_s3_client_new(allocator, &client_config);
   ASSERT_NOT_NULL(client);
   
   // Patch the vtable
   struct aws_s3_client_vtable s3_client_get_requests_header_vtable = *client->vtable;
   s3_client_get_requests_header_vtable.http_connection_make_request = s_get_requests_header_make_request;
   client->vtable = &s3_client_get_requests_header_vtable;
   ```

   Comment: Suggestion for comment accuracy:
   ```
    * Add "x-amz-content-sha256: STREAMING-UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD-TRAILER" header to support trailing checksum.
   ```

   Comment: "is it possible to move this earlier in the function. It's an odd flow, having it after the `finish` goto label, and with the `if (error_code == AWS_ERROR_SUCCESS`"

   Comment: "3 things:
   1) bug: if there's an error here, `error_code` will be -1, but it's *supposed* to be the actual error code
   2) style: please add an explicit `goto finish` after setting error_code. I know it's not technically necessary because this is currently the last thing that can go wrong, but if some future person inserts more logic after this if-branch, they might miss that this if-branch would need a goto
   3) utterly trivial: move this so it happens before `signing_duration_ns` gets set, since that seems like the last thing that should happen"

Context:
This PR was adding support for trailing checksums in requests that aren't signed. When using a trailing checksum, the "x-amz-content-sha256" header needs to be set to a special value even when not signing the request.
