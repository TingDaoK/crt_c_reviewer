   Comment: "So, if users already added a checksum header, they ALSO need to set this enum?"

   Comment: "trivial: I found this if-statement confusing, and the helper function that did different things depending on how it's called, where it's sometimes using local buffers and sometimes using passed-in buffers.
   ```
   if adding-checksum-to-trailer:
       ...
   else
       if adding-checksum-to-header OR adding-checksum-to-buffer
           s_add_checksum_to_header_or_add_checksum_to_buffer()
   ```
   do
   ```
   if adding-checksum-to-trailer:
       ...
   else if adding-checksum-to-header:
       s_add_checksum_to_header()
   else if adding-checksum-to-buffer:
       s_add_checksum_to_buffer()
   ```"

Context:
This PR was adding support for providing checksums in the header instead of in the trailer. With this change, the CRT would read the body into memory, calculate the checksum directly from memory, and add it to the request header instead of the trailer.

Graebm's comments focused on:
1. Clarifying API usage for users who already set checksums
2. Suggesting clearer code structure for handling different checksum modes
3. Pointing out memory leak issues where error paths didn't properly clean up resources
