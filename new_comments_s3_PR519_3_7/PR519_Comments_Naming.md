# PR 519 Review: Variable and Function Naming Issues

## Function Naming

1. Lines 8118-8121: The `test_helper` function doesn't follow the project's naming conventions for helper functions used in tests. In this codebase, helper functions should be prefixed with `s_` to indicate they are static functions with local file scope.

```suggestion
static struct aws_string *s_test_helper(struct aws_allocator *allocator) {
    struct aws_string *host_name =
        aws_s3_tester_build_endpoint_string(allocator, &g_test_public_bucket_name, &g_test_s3_region);
    return host_name;
}
```

2. Lines 8123-8165: The function `aws_test_s3_default_get` should follow the AWS C SDK naming convention where test functions are prefixed with `s_test_`. The AWS_TEST_CASE macro already defines this relationship, but the function implementation should match.

```suggestion
AWS_TEST_CASE(test_s3_default_get, s_test_s3_default_get)
static int s_test_s3_default_get(struct aws_allocator *allocator, void *ctx) {
```

## Variable Naming

3. Line 8139: There's a typo in the variable name `hsot_name` which should be `host_name` for clarity and consistency with other similar variables in the codebase.

```suggestion
    struct aws_string *host_name = s_test_helper(allocator);
```

4. Line 8142: For consistency with other similar code in the file, it would be better to use `aws_byte_cursor_from_string(host_name)` instead of `hsot_name` with the typo.

```suggestion
    struct aws_http_message *message = aws_s3_test_get_object_request_new(
        allocator, aws_byte_cursor_from_string(host_name), g_pre_existing_object_1MB);
```

## General Code Style

5. Lines 8118-8121: The helper function seems unnecessary as it only wraps a single function call. Consider inlining this at the usage site rather than creating a separate function just for this simple operation.

6. Overall structure: This is a duplicated test that appears to be very similar to the existing `s_test_s3_default_get_without_content_length` test. Consider refactoring to make the intention and differences clearer, or remove if it's actually a duplicate.
